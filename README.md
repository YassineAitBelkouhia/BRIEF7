## WHAT IS CMS ?
A content management system, often abbreviated as CMS, is software that helps users create, manage, and modify content on a website without the need for specialized technical knowledge.

### Top 3 CMS :

-Wordpress : The most popular content management system, powers over 1/3 of the internet and it has a large community.
-Drupal : Another popular CMS, you need to be a bit more technical to use it, ultimately it is been used a lot of things like govermment websites because of it s ability to be more secure
-Jumla : Another Popular CMS it's got a good community, has the second highest market share after WORDPRESS

We will be using WORDPRESS for the upcoming projects.
